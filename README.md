# mibreitGallery

## What does it do?

To see what it does, compile the src using _npm run build_ and then open _example/index.html_ in a browser. It shows three usage examples. Mind that this example pulls some content from _www.mibreit-photo.com_ (images and styles).

## Technology

It is a lightweight JavaScript Gallery based on a mix of JS6 and JQuery. The gallery is reduced to a minimum set of functionality and the code was split into different files in an attempt to get a more object oriented result here.
